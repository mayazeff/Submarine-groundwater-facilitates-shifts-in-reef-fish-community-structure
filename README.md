**Abstract:** Coral reefs, despite their remarkable biodiversity and productivity, thrive in oligotrophic environments characterized by low nutrient availability. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) may help resolve this paradox by delivering nutrient- and CO2-rich freshwater through tidally-modulated pulses that create temporally variable resource subsidies. We investigated how SGD affects reef fish ecology by examining community structure, feeding behavior, and herbivory dynamics across SGD-influenced and ambient environments in a tropical coral reef lagoon. Using a combination of video surveys, herbivory assays, and nutrient analyses, we found that SGD drives multi-scale ecological changes from individual feeding behaviors to community restructuring and the coupling of bottom-up nutrient enrichment with top-down consumer control. SGD environments supported 48% higher species richness during peak discharge periods and harbored distinct assemblages dominated by omnivorous and herbivorous fishes, including resident populations of euryhaline species absent from long-term monitoring datasets. Omnivorous fishes exhibited pronounced dietary plasticity exclusively in SGD environments, shifting from benthic to water column feeding during low-tide discharge pulses when enhanced productivity peaked. Herbivory was intensified through two independent mechanisms: algae collected from SGD environments were consumed at 3-fold higher rates likely due to their higher percent nitrogen content, while the fishes feeding within SGD environments promoted 6-fold higher feeding activity regardless of where the consumed algae originated. Together, our results demonstrate that SGD functions as a critical but underappreciated driver of coral reef ecosystem structure and function through the creation of (1) distinct assemblages, (2) temporal shifts in feeding strategies, and (3) coupled nutrient enrichment and enhanced herbivory. The prevalence of SGD in tropical coastal systems globally indicates these ecological patterns may be widespread, with important implications for understanding how localized resource subsidies maintain coral reef biodiversity and function.
